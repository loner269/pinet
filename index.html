            <h4>What is Pi Network?</h4>
            <p>Pi Network is a new cryptocurrency that allows users to mine coins on their mobile devices. It was created by a team of Stanford graduates and aims to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone.</p>
            <p>Pi Network uses a unique consensus algorithm called the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP) to secure its network. This allows users to mine coins without draining their phone's battery or using excessive data.</p>
            <p>Pi Network is currently in its test phase, but it has already gained millions of users worldwide. The team behind Pi Network is working hard to make it a fully functional cryptocurrency that can be used for everyday transactions.</p>
